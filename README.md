# Entity-Level-Security-System

The goal of the project is to design and implement an Entity Level Security (ELS) layer for Python
applications that use an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy). The system enforces permissions on the level of
individual rows (row-level security) and allows granting SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT
privileges to users or roles.
